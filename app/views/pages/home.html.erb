        Many horse owners choose to stable our horses, and ride and train them year-round. Often, this means we need to manage their coat growth, and supplement their care with blankets. Sometimes many blankets. Sometimes... entire wardrobes.

    <h2>Keep track of their clothes</h2>
    <section>
      <div class="p-bg p-bg-image2"></div>
      <p>
        Whether you have one horse with many blankets of different types, blankets for home and for show, or multiple horses each with their own collection of blankets, Blanket Boss will help you keep track of them all.
