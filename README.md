# Blanket Boss

Deployed at: [blanketboss.herokuapp.com](https://blanketboss.herokuapp.com)

### Made for:
This app is built for equestrians who make sure their horses are always comfortably dressed!

This was started as a personal side project, as practice after building [my first complete Rails app](https://github.com/svillegascreative/photogur) with [Bitmaker (GA Toronto)](https://bitmaker.co).

### Made because:
Equestrians have a lots of stuff for their horses. A *LOT* of stuff. Sometimes it can be hard to keep track of. Blanket Boss helps manage equine wardrobes (sheets, coolers, blankets, etc) for one or more horses, allowing a horse owner to keep track of what they have, where it is, what condition it's in, and more.

### Made with:
Ruby on Rails, SCSS, Javascript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat), [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon),[Carrierwave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave), AWS S3, [Sumo Select](https://github.com/HemantNegi/jquery.sumoselect)
